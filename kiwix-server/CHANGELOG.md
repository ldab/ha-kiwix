## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### BREAKING CHANGE

- **Removed Lua module compilation** - too complex with binary compatibility issues
- **Home Assistant ingress has limited functionality** - Kiwix assets won't load correctly
- **Direct network access is the supported method**: `http://IP:8111/`

### Removed

- Removed nginx Lua module build process
- Removed all Lua-based HTML rewriting code
- Removed LuaJIT dependencies

### Why This Change

After extensive attempts to build nginx Lua modules with proper binary compatibility:
- Module compilation succeeded but modules weren't ABI-compatible
- nginx's build environment is complex and hard to replicate
- Building from source added 3+ minutes to build time
- **Reality**: Kiwix's absolute paths are incompatible with HA ingress proxy

**Recommendation**: Use direct network access for full Kiwix functionality.
**Ingress still works** for management interface and basic navigation.

## [1.5.2] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed nginx module binary compatibility by using nginx's original configure arguments
- Modules now compile with exact same configuration as installed nginx
- Fixed Python SyntaxWarning: removed unnecessary backslash escaping in JavaScript regex

### Changed

- Extracts and uses nginx's configure arguments during module compilation
- Ensures compiled modules are binary compatible with container's nginx

## [1.5.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed

## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed

- **MAJOR**: Built nginx Lua modules from source - no more conditional code!

- Home Assistant ingress now works correctly with full Kiwix functionality
- Assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) load correctly in both ingress and direct access

### Changed

- Builds nginx Lua modules from source during Docker build
