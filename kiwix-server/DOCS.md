# Home Assistant Add-on: Kiwix Server

A Kiwix server for serving offline Wikipedia and other ZIM files with a built-in management interface.

## Installation

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Add-ons** → **Add-on Store** in your Home Assistant frontend.
2. Add this repository if not already added.
3. Install the "Kiwix Server" add-on.
4. Configure the add-on (see configuration options below).
5. Start the add-on.

## Access Methods

**Direct Network Access** (Recommended):
- Access via `http://YOUR_HA_IP:8111/`
- **Full Kiwix functionality** - all features work correctly
- Management interface, ZIM browsing, search all work perfectly
- Bookmark this URL for easy access

**Home Assistant Ingress** (Limited):
- Available via HA sidebar
- Management interface works
- Kiwix content has limited functionality (assets may not load)
- **Limitation**: Kiwix uses absolute paths incompatible with ingress proxy

### Why Direct Access?

Kiwix generates HTML with absolute paths (e.g., `/skin/kiwix.css`). When accessed through Home Assistant's ingress proxy at `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/wiki/`, these paths resolve to the wrong location. The proper fix requires server-side HTML rewriting with nginx Lua modules, which have proven too complex to build with proper binary compatibility in the HA environment.

**Solution**: Use direct network access for the best experience.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
port: 8111
management_port: 8112
zim_storage_path: "/data/zim"
log_level: "info"
max_upload_size: 10000
enable_management: true
```

### Configuration Options

#### Server Configuration

- **port**: Port for nginx reverse proxy (default: `8111`)
  - This is the single external port that handles both Kiwix and Management
  - Accessible via Home Assistant ingress and direct network access
  - Routes:
    - `/wiki/` → Kiwix server
    - `/manage/` → Management API
    - `/` → Landing page with tabs

- **zim_storage_path**: Path where ZIM files are stored (default: `/data/zim`)
  - Files stored here will be automatically detected by Kiwix
  - Must be a writable directory

#### Logging

- **log_level**: Logging verbosity level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`)
  - `debug`: Most verbose, shows detailed information
  - `info`: Standard logging (default)
  - `warning`: Only warnings and errors
  - `error`: Only errors

#### File Management

- **max_upload_size**: Maximum upload size in MB (default: `10000`)
  - Limits the size of ZIM files that can be uploaded via the management interface
  - Large ZIM files (like full Wikipedia) can be several GB

- **enable_management**: Enable the management interface (default: `true`)
  - Set to `false` to disable the management API and UI
  - Kiwix server will still work, but you won't be able to manage files via the web interface

## Using the Management Interface

The management interface is available at `http://homeassistant-ip:8112` when the add-on is running.

## Accessing Kiwix Content

### Via Home Assistant Ingress (Recommended)

**✅ Fully Functional**: The add-on uses nginx reverse proxy with path rewriting to ensure all features work correctly via ingress.

1. Open Home Assistant
2. Click on "Kiwix" in the sidebar
3. You'll see a tabbed interface:
   - **Kiwix Wiki tab**: Browse and search ZIM files
   - **Management tab**: Download, upload, and manage ZIM files
4. All features work correctly:
   - ✅ Full CSS styling
   - ✅ Working JavaScript
   - ✅ Complete ZIM file list
   - ✅ Functional category and language selectors

### Via Direct Network Access

**Single Port Access:**
- **Landing Page**: `http://homeassistant-ip:8111/` - Tabbed interface (same as ingress)
- **Kiwix Wiki**: `http://homeassistant-ip:8111/wiki/` - Direct Kiwix access
- **Management**: `http://homeassistant-ip:8111/manage/` - File management

**To find your Home Assistant IP address:**
- Check your router's device list
- Or use `http://homeassistant.local:8111` if mDNS is enabled
- Or check Home Assistant Settings → System → Network

All features work identically via ingress or direct network access.

### Using ZIM Files

Once ZIM files are added:

1. Kiwix automatically detects new ZIM files (using `--monitorLibrary`)
2. No restart is needed when adding or removing files
3. Browse available content through the Kiwix interface
4. Search and read content offline

## Popular ZIM Files

## Network Configuration

### Ports

The add-on uses two ports:

- **8111/tcp**: Kiwix server (content serving)
- **8112/tcp**: Management API (file management)

Both ports are exposed and can be accessed from your local network.

### Firewall Configuration

If you want external access:

1. **Allow inbound TCP traffic** on port 8111 (Kiwix server)
2. **Allow inbound TCP traffic** on port 8112 (Management interface, optional)

### Router Configuration

For external access, configure port forwarding:

- Forward external port → 8111 (Kiwix server)
- Forward external port → 8112 (Management, optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Kiwix server not starting**
- Check that port 8111 is not in use by another service
- Verify ZIM storage path is writable
- Check add-on logs for error messages

**2. Management interface not accessible**
- Check that port 8112 is not in use
- Verify `enable_management` is set to `true`
- Check add-on logs for management API errors
- **IMPORTANT**: Ensure port 8112 is enabled in the add-on's **Network** settings tab
  - Go to add-on → Network tab → Enable port 8112/tcp
- Verify the port is exposed: `nc -zv homeassistant-ip 8112`

**3. ZIM files not appearing**
- Verify files are in the correct directory (check `zim_storage_path`)
- Ensure files have `.zim` extension
- Check file permissions (should be readable)
- Kiwix uses `--monitorLibrary` to auto-detect files, but may take a few seconds

**4. Download fails**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify URL is accessible
- Check available disk space
- Large files may take a long time to download

**5. Upload fails**
- Check file size doesn't exceed `max_upload_size`
- Verify file has `.zim` extension
- Check available disk space
- Ensure file is a valid ZIM file

### Logs

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```yaml
log_level: "debug"
```

View logs in the Home Assistant add-on logs section.

### Checking ZIM Files

To manually check ZIM files:

1. Access the management interface
2. View the list of ZIM files
3. Check file sizes and dates
4. Verify files are valid ZIM format

## Performance Optimization

### Storage

- **Disk Space**: ZIM files can be very large (10-100GB+ for full Wikipedia)
- **Storage Location**: Ensure `zim_storage_path` has sufficient space
- **SSD Recommended**: For better performance, use SSD storage

### Network

- **Bandwidth**: Large ZIM files take significant time to download
- **Local Network**: For faster transfers, download on a local machine and upload
- **Multiple Files**: Kiwix can serve multiple ZIM files efficiently

### Resource Usage

- **CPU**: Low CPU usage, mainly for serving content
- **Memory**: Approximately 50-200MB base, plus caching
- **Disk I/O**: Moderate I/O when serving content

## Security Considerations

### Network Security

- **Local Network Only**: By default, accessible only on local network
- **External Access**: If exposing externally, consider firewall rules
- **Management Interface**: The management interface (port 8112) should ideally be restricted to local network

### File Security

- **ZIM Files**: ZIM files are read-only, safe to serve
- **Uploads**: Validate uploaded files are actual ZIM files
- **Storage**: Ensure storage directory has proper permissions

### Recommendations

- Keep management interface on local network only
- Use firewall rules to restrict access if needed
- Regularly update the add-on for security patches

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Storage Path

For custom storage locations:

```yaml
zim_storage_path: "/share/kiwix/zim"
```

Ensure the path exists and is writable.

### Disabling Management Interface

To disable the management interface:

```yaml
enable_management: false
```

You'll need to manually add ZIM files via SSH or other methods.

### Large File Uploads

For very large ZIM files:

```yaml
max_upload_size: 50000  # 50GB
```

Note: Large uploads may take significant time and bandwidth.

## API Endpoints

The management API provides REST endpoints:

- `GET /api/zim` - List all ZIM files
- `POST /api/zim/download` - Download ZIM from URL
- `POST /api/zim/upload` - Upload ZIM file
- `DELETE /api/zim/{filename}` - Delete ZIM file
- `GET /api/zim/{filename}/info` - Get ZIM file info
- `GET /api/download/{job_id}/status` - Get download progress
